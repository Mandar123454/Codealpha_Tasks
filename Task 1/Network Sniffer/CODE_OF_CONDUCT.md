✅ "This approach might have issues with X"
❌ "This is obviously wrong"
```

### When Receiving Feedback
```
✅ "Thank you for the feedback, I'll consider that"
❌ "Your feedback is stupid"

✅ "I see your point, let me explain my reasoning"
❌ "You don't understand my code"

✅ "Let's discuss the trade-offs"
❌ "I don't care what you think"
```

### In Discussions
```
✅ "I respectfully disagree because..."
❌ "Anyone who thinks that is an idiot"

✅ "That's an interesting perspective, but..."
❌ "That's obviously wrong"

✅ "Could you explain your reasoning?"
❌ "You're clearly not qualified to comment"
```
